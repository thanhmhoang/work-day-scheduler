# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

For this Module 5 Challenge, the challege was to build a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. The motivation for building this application as an employee or a student, we have busy schedules and want a method to organize all important events in one spot. This application operates as a daily planner so time can be managed effectively. This application will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. Through doing this challenge, I was able to have a better understanding of how to use jQuery to dynamically modify applications without having to alter HTML and CSS. 
## Installation

## Usage

To use this work day scheduler/planner, please click on this link, https://thanhmhoang.github.io/work-day-scheduler/. When users reach the webpage, they can use the daily planner to create a schedule. When the scheduler is opened, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. When the user scrolls down, there will be time blocks for standard business hours, each time block is color coded to indicate where it is in the past, present, or future. Gray is for past events, red is for the present, and green is for future events. When the user clicks on a specific time block they can input an event and click the save button for that specific time block that is to the right of the time block. The event input will be save in local storage and once the page is refresh, the saved event will still persist there.
